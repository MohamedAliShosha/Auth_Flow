# Flutter Authentication Flow
## This is a simple Flutter project that demonstrates a basic authentication flow with two screens: Sign Up and Sign In. It provides a clean and minimal implementation that can be extended or integrated into larger projects.

## Features:
## * Sign Up Screen:
## - Allows users to register with basic details (e.g., email and password .. etc).
## * Sign In Screen:
## - Allows users to log in with their registered credentials or using Google or Facebook.

## How It Works:
## 1. Sign Up:
## - Users enter their details (e.g., email, password).
## - On successful sign-up, users are redirected to the Sign In screen.

## 2. Sign In:
## - Users log in using their registered credentials.
## - On successful login, users can proceed to the next part of the app (to be implemented).
